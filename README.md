# Bakery42
another attempt at creating my own kind of raspberry pi distributed computing

# Setup
To setup nodes in the network create a `.env` file containing the IP addresses of all the nodes you want to use. For ex:
```
NODE1=raspberry@192.168.1.101
NODE2=raspberry@192.168.1.102
NODE3=raspberry@192.168.1.103
NODE4=raspberry@192.168.1.104
```

**Under Construction - Stay Tuned! **
